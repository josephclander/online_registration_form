# Online Registration Form

## Project Requirements

To build a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files build a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.

## Instructions

### 1. For this project we will be checking the design in Google Chrome version 48 or higher.

### 2. Use the supplied mockup files to build a mobile-ready registration form.

### 3. Use a mobile-first approach: make sure the basic design (without media queries) matches the mobile design in the mobile-form.png.

Make sure the HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document, see the project resources for links to "Using the viewport meta tag" and "Configuring the Viewport".

### 4. Use CSS media queries to change the layout of the form at screen widths of 760 pixels or wider, to match the desktop design in the desktop-form.png file.

### 5. Make sure you include the following form field types:

- text input
- email input
- telephone input
- select menu
- checkboxes
- radio buttons
- textfield
- submit button

### 6. Use descriptive names for the form inputs -- for example, "email" for the email field, not "e" or "xyz."

### 7. Add labels to the form fields using the HTML `<label>` tag

### 8. Use the input field's placeholder attribute to add "required" to

- the Full Name field
- the Email address field

### 9. Make sure you properly pair `<label>` elements with form controls via the `for` attribute.

### 10. Add "focus" states to the form for when a user clicks or tabs into a text field.

### 11. Add two fieldsets and legends for the

- "Contact Information" section of the page, and
- The "Newsletter" section of the page.

**Note:** You don't need to make a functioning form -- that is, it doesn't have to do anything when the form is submitted. To do that, you'd need to add some server-side programming to actually process the user's input.

### 12. Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.

- Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
- There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:
  - Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
  - If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored.
  - If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.

## Extra Credit

1. Additional breakpoints for other browser widths like tablets.

2. Add additional form fields to build a more complex form with additional options.

3. Additional placeholder text for other text fields.

4. Use HTML5 validation to make sure that required fields are filled out and input is formatted correctly.

5. Use a Google Font for the text. The design uses the free "Merriweather" font, which you can find a link to in the Project Resources. But, you can use any Google Font that you'd like.

6. Enhance the style of the form with graphics, background colors, etc. Just make sure you leave the basic layout the same as the mockup.

7. Use CSS Transition effects for highlighting the look of the form fields both when they are "focused" and "blurred."
   - For example, make a background color fade into view when the field the user clicks into a text field, and fade out when the user clicks or tabs out of the field.

## Notes from the build

Tested on the following browsers: Chrome 87, Safari 14.0.1 and Firefox 84.0b7.

The select form field is different on each of the browsers. Initially I assumed it was just the down arrows but Safari wouldn't remove the 3D styling without removing the arrow as well. I believed the arrow alone may have been ok being slightly different across browsers as you cannot control the looks when you click just with CSS. However Safari's shading was bit much so I added a custom one.

The fieldset legend acted differently on Chrome to how it did on Firefox and Safari. To be able to style it I swapped the legend for an h3 tag which I thought would still hold some semantic placement.

The phone number tag has a type attribute of 'tel' and I put a placeholder in there to show a UK mobile type. I read that there is mixed approaches from browsers with this. I'm sure a more standard approach is some backend validation for formatting the number.

On Safari, I noticed that the text, 'CSS' on the SVG in the background doesn't render centrally as it should and does on Chrome and Firefox. As this is a minor embelishment, I will leave it at this stage. It would be unfortunate if it needs to be converted to a png or jpeg.
